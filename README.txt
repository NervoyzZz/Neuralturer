Hello everybody! That's my first experience with 'true' project development.
It's begin with my wish to learn machine learning. But earlier (and now)
I dreamed to be game developer. So I decided to combine this two sides
of my interest.

Main idea:
This game will be like ZPG, player will have minimal influence to the hero.
The hero will live in some World, he will travel and meet some bad guys, they 
will fight and hero will learn with every fight. And in the future he will 
guess: can he bite his enemy or not and if not he will flee from battle.

Game World:
First of all, there will be a Capital, a big city, where everything
interesting will be provided. Hero can rest, speak with townsmen, bye
equipment such as weapons, armours, potions, also Hero can heal his wounds.
If Hero wants to earn money and fame he can participate in competitions 
on the Arena. Free from rest time our Hero spend for travelling,
he is Adventurer. Hero can travel to some places (more information in game),
fight his foes, take their gold, meet Bosses (unique strong enemies), get
their equipment.
I make RPG game, so Hero has a lot of parameters, that can influence
to his life and his success. Every parameter is useful so choose carefuly
what to improve first.


That's all for now. More information will be provided with Player Guide when
game will created.

Thanks for your attention!
