Neuralturer game.
That's my first experience with 'true' project development.
It's begin with my wish to learn machin learning. But earlier I dreamed
to be game developer. So I decided to combine this two sides of my interest.

Main idea:
This game will be like ZPG, player will have minimal influence to the hero.
The hero will live in some World, he will travel and meet some bad guys, they 
will fight and hero will learn with every fight. And in the future he will 
guess: can he bite his enemy or not and if not he will flee from battle.

More information will be provided later
