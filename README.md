## Quick start
### What is it?
Hello everybody! That's my first experience with 'true' project development. It's begin with my wish to learn machine learning. But earlier (and now) I dreamed to be game developer. So I decided to combine this two sides of my interest. Let me present you **Neuralturer** game!
### How to begin play
1. Just download all files from my repository
2. Be sure you have Python 3.*
3. call "python3 main.py" from directory with project
### How to develop
1. File AdConstFile.py contains constants like Enemies, Weapons, Armours
2. File AdFuncFile.py contains classes and functions that very useful for game
3. Yes, I think about parting classes and function, but still I have one file
4. File main.py contains few rows of code. It just calls right functions
### What help can be useful
1. I really need to have more Enemies, Weapons and Armours
2. Code optimization

## Game Idea
This game will be like ZPG, player will have minimal influence to the hero. Player desides what to do, but Hero do it by himself. This game is RPG. So think twice wile you train your Hero. The hero will live in some World, he will travel and meet some bad guys, they will fight and hero will learn with every fight. And in the future he will guess: can he bite his enemy or not and if not he will flee from battle.

## Game World
First of all, there will be a Capital, a big city, where everything interesting will be provided (Now it's named 'City'). Hero can rest, speak with townsmen, buy equipment such as weapons, armours, potions, also Hero can heal his wounds. If Hero wants to earn money and fame he can participate in competitions on the Arena. Free from rest time our Hero spend for travelling, he is Adventurer. Hero can travel to some places (more information in game), fight his foes, take their gold, meet Bosses (unique strong enemies), get their equipment. I make RPG game, so Hero has a lot of parameters, that can influence to his life and his success. Every parameter is useful so choose carefuly what to improve first.

## What is in game now?
1. There's main City
2. You can buy new equipment
3. You can participate in competitions
4. You can heal your Hero
5. You can LvL up your Hero
6. You can save game
